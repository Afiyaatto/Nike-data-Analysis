Dataset From Kaggle
Source: nike_data_2022_09.csv

Contents: Product names, prices, ratings, reviews, availability, colors, and descriptions.

Tools & Libraries
This analysis is conducted using R with the following libraries:

tidyverse for data manipulation

lubridate for handling dates

ggplot2 for visualizations

tm and wordcloud for text analysis

Analysis & Visualizations
Price Distribution: Histogram to show pricing trends.

Product Availability: Bar chart highlighting stock levels.

Price vs Rating: Scatter plot analyzing customer satisfaction vs price.

Top Reviewed Products: List of highly rated items.

Text Analysis: Word cloud of product descriptions.

Key Findings & Recommendations
✔ Most products are priced between $40-$80—competitive pricing should focus here. ✔ Products with zero reviews need customer feedback to build trust. ✔ Monitor out-of-stock items for replenishment or discontinuation. ✔ Common keywords in descriptions include "comfort," "fit," and "dry"—use these in branding. ✔ Feature top-rated products more prominently to drive sales.
